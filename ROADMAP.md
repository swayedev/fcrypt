### Roadmap

To bring clarity to planned future upgrades, Fcrypt needed to have a roadmap to list planned functionality and insight into the projects upcoming goals:

1. **Cloud Key Storage Integration**  
   - **Goal**: Provide an optional cloud key storage add-on, allowing users to securely store and retrieve encryption keys from major cloud providers (e.g., AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault).
   - **Status**: Research and planning stage, evaluating API integrations for seamless support across providers.
   - **Target Release**: Planned for version 0.3.0.

2. **Extended Elliptic Curve Support**  
   - **Goal**: Enhance decryption capabilities to support additional elliptic curves beyond the currently implemented standards. This will allow interoperability with data encrypted under other elliptic curve algorithms, making Fcrypt more versatile for cross-application compatibility.
   - **Status**: In development, focusing on commonly used curves like secp256k1.
   - **Target Release**: Planned for version 0.4.0.

3. **Improved Key Management and Rotation Tools**  
   - **Goal**: Introduce more granular key rotation and management tools, including automated rotation schedules and compatibility with cloud key storage.
   - **Status**: Conceptual phase, looking at best practices in secure key rotation automation.
   - **Target Release**: Future versions (TBD).
